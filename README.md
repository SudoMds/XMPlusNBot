XMPlus Node Management By telegram bot[AutoInstall]
# Whats this?
This is a bash script that develop python and pythonenv and a control menu to turn on your bot on your XMPlus Node(VPS Server)
# How To?
1.First Create Your Bot by Botfather

2.Get Your ChatID from telegram here https://t.me/chatIDrobot

3.wget the script to your vps

5.installer ask your Bot token
6.installer ask your chat id
7.wait untill installion done
8. command in the server: bot
 a menu will appear and no need to give detail about it 
 1.start bot
 2.stop bot
 3.restart bot
 4.exit
open your telegram and go to your bot chat and send  "/start"  (remove "" this)
 in telegram chat you have 3 buttons ("Restart XMPlus","Restart Server","ifconfig")
"here we set ifconfig button for testing connection between your node and telegram"
 Note: if you set multiplie servers on the same telegrambot you need to repeat commands each time you repeat a server will get the command and its a bug that i don't have enough time to fix it" good luck
